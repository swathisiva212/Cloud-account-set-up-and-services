## AWS: 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform provided by 
Amazon that offers a wide range of on-demand computing services. It allows 
businesses and developers to use scalable and cost-effective infrastructure 
without having to own physical hardware. AWS operates on a pay-as-you-go
pricing model, meaning users only pay for what they use.

i. Compute & Networking 
These services provide cloud computing power and networking capabilities to 
support scalable applications. They are also known as Infrastructure-as-a-Service 
(IaaS). 
 Amazon EC2 - Amazon EC2 stands for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. 
Provides virtual machines (VMs) with storage, memory, central processing 
units (CPUs), and networking capabilities.

 Amazon Lambda -A cloud computing service that allows developers to 
run code without managing servers. Allows users to run code without 
managing or provisioning servers. 

 Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service - A service that allows users to run 
Kubernetes in AWS and on-premises data centres. It automates the 
management of Kubernetes clusters. Allows users to manage and run their 
infrastructure in a Kubernetes environment. Kubernetes is an open-source 
tool that helps users automate, scale, deploy, and operate containerized 
applications. 
 . 
ii. Storage & Content Delivery 
These services handle scalable storage, data backup, and content delivery. Cloud￾based services that provide storage for data. These services are designed to be 
reliable, scalable, and secure. 

 Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) - Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is 
a cloud-based storage service that allows users to create and manage 
storage volumes for Amazon EC2 instances. These volumes can be used to 
store files, install applications, and more. 

 Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) - Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is 
a cloud-based file storage service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
that allows users to create and access shared file systems that can be easily 
scaled up or down based on their needs, without the need to manage 
underlying storage infrastructure.

 Amazon S3 - Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a cloud storage 
service that lets users store and access data online 

iii Database 
AWS provides managed databases for different workloads, from relational to 
NoSQL and data warehousing. 
● Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) – Managed relational 
databases. Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL 
Server, and Amazon Aurora. Is a Automatic backups, scaling, and 
maintenance. 

● Amazon DynamoDB – Fully managed NoSQL database (key-value & 
document store) High-speed, scalable apps like gaming, IoT, and real￾time analytics. Serverless, low latency, and auto-scales to handle traffic 
spikes. 

● Amazon Redshift – Cloud data warehouse for analytics. Business 
intelligence (BI), data analysis, and big data processing. High 
performance, integrates with BI tools, cost-effective for large datasets. 

iv. Developer & DevOps Tools: 
Services for building, deploying, and managing applications. 
 AWS Code Commit – Managed Git repository. 

 AWS Code Build – Continuous integration for building applications.

 AWS Code Deploy – Automates application deployment.

v) Analytics & AI in AWS: 
A comprehensive set of capabilities for every analytics workload, optimized 
for price performance and scale. 
 AWS Glue – ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Service - AWS Glue is a 
serverless data integration service used for data extraction, transformation, 
and loading (ETL). It automates data preparation for analytics and 
machine learning.

 Amazon Kinesis – Real-time Data Streaming - Amazon Kinesis allows 
businesses to collect, process, and analyse real-time data streams. It is 
commonly used for log analytics, IoT data processing, and live video 
streaming. 

 Amazon Quick Sight – Business Intelligence & Visualization -Amazon 
Quick Sight is a cloud-powered BI tool for creating interactive dashboards 
and reports. It helps organizations visualize data and uncover insights.

VI. Mobile & Application Services 
AWS provides tools to build, deploy, and manage mobile applications. 
 AWS Amplify – Full-stack mobile and web app development.

 Amazon Cognito – User authentication and identity management.

 Amazon API Gateway – API management service. 
Applications of AWS:
